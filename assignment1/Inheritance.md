## Inheritance in interface
#inheritance
iheritance are the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. 
With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and 
the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

An interface is a special form of an abstract class which does not implement any methods.One interface can inherit
another by use of the keyword **extends** . The synatx is the same as for inheriting classes. When a class implements an 
interface that inherits another
interface,it must provide implementations for all methods required by the interface inheritance chain
**Inheritance in interfaace  also called as multiple inheritance in java**
